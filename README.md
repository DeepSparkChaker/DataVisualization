## Data Science Guide:
Cross-industry standard process for data mining, known as CRISP-DM, is an open standard process model that describes common approaches used by data mining experts. It is the most widely-used analytics mode.

CRISP-DM breaks the process of data mining into six major phases:

    Business Understanding
    Data Understanding
    Data Preparation
    Modeling
    Evaluation
    Deployment

The sequence of the phases is not strict and moving back and forth between different phases as it is always required.
